			PANDAS:

Imports (typical setup):
	- import numpy as np
	- import pandas as pd

General Terminology Translation:
	- PANDAS Term = EXCEL Term 
	- DataFrame = Worksheet
		--> While an excel workbook can contain many worksheets, pandas DataFrame's exist independently
	- Series = Column
		--> Data structure which represents one column of a dataframe
	- Index = Row Headings
		--> Essentially, labels on the rows of the data
		--> If no index is specified, a RangeIndex is used by default (i.e. row 1=0, row2= 1)
		--> In excel, as opposed to A1:Z1, you could do populations.loc['Chicago'] where Chicago is the index (row name)
	- Row = Row
	- NaN = Empty Cell


Copies vs. in place operations:
	- Since most pandasa operations return copies of the DataFrame, you will either need to assign the result to a new variable or overwrite the old one

Constructing a DataFrame:
	- In excel, you may click into a cell and type in values
	- In pandas, you should pass in the values in the form of a python dictionary, where the keys are the column names and the values are each row
	In [3]: df = pd.DataFrame({"x": [1, 3, 5], "y": [2, 4, 6]})

	In [4]: df
	Out[4]: 
	   x  y
	0  1  2
	1  3  4
	2  5  6

Reading External Data: 
	In [5]: url = (
	   ...:     "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev"
	   ...:     "/pandas/main/pandas/tests/io/data/csv/tips.csv"
	   ...: )
	   ...: 

	In [6]: tips = pd.read_csv(url)
	
	In [7]: tips
	Out[7]: 
	     total_bill   tip     sex smoker   day    time  size
	0         16.99  1.01  Female     No   Sun  Dinner     2
	1         10.34  1.66    Male     No   Sun  Dinner     3
	2         21.01  3.50    Male     No   Sun  Dinner     3
	3         23.68  3.31    Male     No   Sun  Dinner     2
	4         24.59  3.61  Female     No   Sun  Dinner     4
	..          ...   ...     ...    ...   ...     ...   ...
	239       29.03  5.92    Male     No   Sat  Dinner     3
	240       27.18  2.00  Female    Yes   Sat  Dinner     2
	241       22.67  2.00    Male    Yes   Sat  Dinner     2
	242       17.82  1.75    Male     No   Sat  Dinner     2
	243       18.78  3.00  Female     No  Thur  Dinner     2

	[244 rows x 7 columns]
	
Limiting Output:
	tips.head(5) --> Get the first 5 rows
	tips.tail(5) --> Get the last 5 rows

_________________________________________________________

Dataset = A dataset refers to a structured collection of data instances or samples that are used for training, testing, or evaluating a machine learning model

Data instance = An individual observation/example that comprises a dataset. For example, in a dataset for predicting housing prices, each data instance in this case could represent a single house and would consist of various attributes or features such as footage, numbers, location etc.

Attribute/Feature/Variable = A measurable property or characteristic of an object that is used as input to a machine learning model
